The license is one of the most crucial artefacts within any software project.
This is especially so in the case of Open Source; it is the license which
provides the legal grounds for the project owners' stance of Freedom and
openness. Simply put, without an OSI or FSF-approved license in place, your
project can hardly claim to be Open Source / Free Software.

At the heart of any genuine Open Source license, is the provision of the four
freedoms. Beyond that, the nuances between licenses really serve to set
expectations around how you can _contribute_ to the project with one universal
truth: these license want to encourage contribution.

Recently, a new document (note, not a complete license) called "Commons Clause"
was released. The Commons Clause is designed to be applied to existing Open
Source projects to provide a commercial restriction:

> Without limiting other conditions in the License, the grant of rights under
> the License will not include, and the License does not grant to you, the
> right to Sell the Software.

In short: it restricts your freedom to sell the software.

# The Spirit of Open Source

In practice, the Commons Clause is pretty limited: it allows you to engage in
pretty much all the most common forms of monetisation of software, but you
cannot sell a product based upon the software which does not add value (e.g. if
you rename the software and _then_ host it as a service). 

But this simple restriction is hugely important: applying it means the software
is no-longer Open Source.

## Freedom 0: The Fundamental Freedom

Ultimately software exists to satisfy some problem. Without the ability to run
the software, you are disabled from solving your problem. Freedom 0 is simple:

> The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.

The Commons Clause does not restrict you on purpose. You want to consult on the
software? Go right ahead. Want to use the software inside weapons? Go right
ahead. Want to use the software to power life saving hospital equipment? Go
right ahead! Where Commons Clause _does_ restrict us is on the "as you wish"
part; but this invalidates the entire Freedom and, thus, stops the whole body
of the software from being Open Source.

When you launch a project as Open Source you _explicitly_ make this covenant
towards your community. Even if they never intend to invoke the privilege.
Meanwhile the community contributes! Their active engagement with the project
ultimately serves to make the product better. To retro-actively invoke your
rights as the copyright holder to restrict their freedoms is an insult.

Ask yourself: "Would everyone have contributed to a commnuity if the Commons
Clause was in place from the start?"

Applying the Commons Clause to a project breaks a special convenant between
the project's founders and the community. Participants within the community are
concurrently incentivised and rewarded with Freedom 0. By taking this freedom
away, a projects erodes trust with its community and raises very serious
questions about the motives of the founders.

# The Problems of Monetisation

In general, it is very hard to simply take a piece of Open Source software and
sell it as-is. A certain amount of value-add is required because the software
itself is freely-available. The "trick" is to focus on what customers _do_ want
to buy... productisation. This may be anything from documentation, to reliable
packaging to consulting. MOAR FEATURES!


- Can't sell something that is Free/free
- So what can we sell?
  - Consulting
  - Feature development
  - Training
  - Lots of things!
- It can be done! Look at RedHat!

# Taking A Stand Against Commons Clause
- CC fundamentally at odds with Open Source
- Actualy _creates_ risk for enterprise adoption
- Harms the community
- We are not banning it (but we take the political stance of recommending it is
  not adopted)
  - Why?
