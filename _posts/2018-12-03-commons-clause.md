# Introduction
- What is the CC license?
- Where/why was it created?

# The Spirit of Open Source
- The importance of Freedom 0
- When you commit to Open Source, you commit to your community
- Commons Clause breaks this covenant

# The Problems of Monetisation
- Can't sell something that is Free/free
- So what can we sell?
  - Consulting
  - Feature development
  - Training
  - Lots of things!
- It can be done! Look at RedHat!

# Taking A Stand Against Commons Clause
- CC fundamentally at odds with Open Source
- Actualy _creates_ risk for enterprise adoption
- Harms the community
- We are not banning it (but we take the political stance of recommending it is
  not adopted)
  - Why?
